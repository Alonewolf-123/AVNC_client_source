## What is VNC?
In computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.[1]

## About AVNC
AVNC is Virtual Network Computing developed by electronjs and webrtc.
AVNC client is the program that represents the screen data originating from the server, receives updates from it and presumably controls it by informing the server of collected local input.
